# CherryLockManager

## What it is?
It's a manager program for [CherryLock](https://github.com/adamj57/CherryLock)

## What it does?
It's currently in **heavy development**, but it can do those things:

- Read a log file,
- Read a database file, 
- get data from database and show it in log view.

I know, it's poor, but...

## What it'll be able to do?

- Modify a database file,
- Connect to CherryLock,
- Download a raw database from CherryLock,
- Upload a database into CherryLock,
- Modify the master card ID in the memory of CherryLock,
- And possibly many, many more!
